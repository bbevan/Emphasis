# Emphasis
Reads in a plaintext file from the command line. Outputs a randomly emphasized and bolded HTML5 file by adding either 
`<b></b>` or `<i></i>` tags to random words.

## use
`$~ python3 emphasize.py text.txt > emphasized_text.txt`

## Example output
`text.txt`
Slouching away from the twisted sheets no laundered item rested on the chair, or layed neatly folded in oak drawers, or layed 
dirty on the floor. Beyond comprehension clothing I own had vanished. I wore the pair of jeans slept in, a red hoodie and blue 
sports coat paired with black slippers out the door late. The heat built-up in Spring. It was humid and I could feel the skipped 
shower manifesting itself within the aroma of my unwashed clothes. One shoe worn down to the skin. The other talking. Jeans 
slightly sagged from sweat and the sun shown hard into the corneas of my eyes.

# Unit Tests
The unit tests included with Emphasize effectively test the random nature of `choosemph()` and `applyemph()`. They do this with a pre-generated list of random numbers generated by the seed `123456789`. For every test that's called, one number is popped off the list while feeding the seed to the functions. That way, `unittest` knows ahead of time which random numbers will be called. Then the test function can select the correct unit to check on runtime.

# Note
Firefox does not always render `em` tags without a CSS file.
