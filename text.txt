Slouching away from the twisted sheets no laundered item rested on the chair, or layed neatly folded in oak drawers, or layed dirty on the floor. Beyond comprehension clothing I own had vanished. I wore the pair of jeans slept in, a red hoodie and blue sports coat paired with black slippers out the door late. The heat built-up in Spring. It was humid and I could feel the skipped shower manifesting itself within the aroma of my unwashed clothes. One shoe worn down to the skin. The other talking. Jeans slightly sagged from sweat and the sun shown hard into the corneas of my eyes.
